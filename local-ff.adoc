= Fast-forward merge on local branches

If you need to do some work on a local branch A, but want to keep the
state so it is easy to revert to, you can make a branch B  
from A and work on that.

Maybe while you are working on B, you make some additional, 
mostly-unrelated changes to the original branch A.

How to bring them back together?

To bring the A changes into B at any stage, make sure you are on 
B:
[source,shell]
----
$ git checkout B
----
and then rebase against A

[source,shell]
----
$ git rebase A
----
This may result in conflicts, which are resolved in the usual way.

When you are satisfied with B, you perform, if necessary, a final 
rebase against A. 
Then do a fast-forward merge:

[source,shell]
----
$ checkout A
$ git merge --ff B
----
Now HEAD for A points at the tip of B, and there is a linear history.
The command `git branch` shows both A and B branches. 
You no longer need B, so remove it:

[source,shell]
----
$ git branch -d B
----
